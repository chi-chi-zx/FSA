## TL;DR
> *Prior works refine intermediate attention but face limitations: (1) improvements may not propagate to final segmentation; (2) attention lacks direct class information. We introduce a feedback-driven self-adaptive mechanism that reintegrates semantic outputs with visual and textual cues into CLIP. Our approach is orthogonal to existing methods and serves as a plug-in.*

## Dependencies and Installation


```
# git clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/chi-chi-zx/FSA.git
cd FSA

# create new anaconda env
conda create -n FSA python=3.10
conda activate FSA

# install torch and dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Datasets
Please follow the [MMSeg data preparation document](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/main/docs/en/user_guides/2_dataset_prepare.md) and [ProxyCLIP](https://github.com/mc-lan/ProxyCLIP/tree/main) to download and pre-process the datasets. 
The COCO-Object dataset can be converted from COCO-Stuff164k by executing the following command:

```
python datasets/cvt_coco_object.py PATH_TO_COCO_STUFF164K -o PATH_TO_COCO164K
```

## Model evaluation

In this repo, we integrate our FSA into ProxyCLIP (using sam, mae, dino, dinov2 as the VFMs). Please check `hyper_param.txt` for the hyper parameters.

Please modify some settings in `configs/base_config.py` before running the evaluation.

For SAM and MAE, please download the checkpoints from [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#model-checkpoints) and [MAE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae).



Single-GPU:

```
python eval.py --config ./config/cfg_DATASET.py --workdir YOUR_WORK_DIR
```

Multi-GPU:
```
bash ./dist_test.sh ./config/cfg_DATASET.py
```

Evaluation on all datasets:
```
python eval_all.py
```
Results will be saved in `results.xlsx`.
